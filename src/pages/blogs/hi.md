Define the term "computational systems."
Computational systems are systems that use computers to perform calculations, process information, or solve problems automatically. They include both the hardware (machines) and software (programs) components involved in computation.
1.	What was the name of the first computer-like device, and who created it?
The first computer-like device was the “Difference Engine”, created by Charles Babbage in 1822.
2.	What was the basis for the development of the first modern computer, the ENIAC?
The basis for the ENIAC was Alan Turing’s concept of a universal machine (1937), which could perform any mathematical computation.
3.	Who coined the term "Artificial Intelligence," and what was the significance of the Dartmouth Conference?
John McCarthy coined the term Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 1956. The Dartmouth Conference is significant because it is considered the birthplace of AI, where researchers first formally gathered to study and develop AI.
4.	What was the impact of the development of the internet on Computer Science?
The development of the internet in the 1980s revolutionized communication and information sharing, enabling applications such as email and the World Wide Web, and opening the way for new technologies and software development.
5.	In what decade did the field of Computer Science emerge?
The field of Computer Science emerged in the 1950s.
6.	How has Computer Science impacted other fields, such as medicine and finance?
o	In medicine, computers and algorithms help researchers analyze large datasets and develop new treatments for diseases.
o	In finance, computers allow traders to analyze market data and make informed investment decisions.
