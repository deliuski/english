Comprehension Questions
1.	What are algorithms?
Algorithms are sets of instructions that a computer or machine can follow to perform a specific task.
2.	What role do algorithms play in modern technology?
Algorithms are the building blocks of computer programs and are used to solve problems, optimize processes, and automate tasks.
3.	Give an example of an application of algorithms.
o	Search engines use algorithms to rank web pages.
o	Online retailers use algorithms to recommend products based on purchase history.
4.	What factors should be considered when designing an algorithm?
o	Efficiency (task completion time)
o	Scalability (ability to handle larger datasets)
o	Accuracy (producing correct results)
5.	How do programmers create algorithms?
Programmers write code in a programming language describing the steps of the algorithm, then test and optimize it for efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
6.	How can algorithms be classified based on the type of problem they solve?
Examples:
o	Sorting algorithms: arrange data in a specific order
o	Searching algorithms: find a specific item within a dataset
7.	What is time complexity?
Time complexity is the amount of time it takes an algorithm to complete as the size of the input data increases.
8.	What is the difference between brute-force and divide-and-conquer algorithms?
o	Brute-force algorithms try every possible solution to solve a problem.
o	Divide-and-conquer algorithms break a problem into smaller sub-problems that are easier to solve.
9.	What are machine learning algorithms?
Machine learning algorithms use statistical models to identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns, and are used in applications like image recognition, speech recognition, NLP, and recommendation systems.
10.	What is algorithmic fairness?
Algorithmic fairness is the development of algorithms that do not discriminate against individuals based on race, gender, socio-economic status, or other factors.
11.	Define algorithm.
A set of instructions a computer or machine follows to perform a specific task.
12.	Give a synonym for the word 'crucial'.
Essential, important, or vital
13.	What does the term 'optimize' mean?
To make something as effective, efficient, or functional as possible.
14.	What is meant by the term 'scalable'?
Capable of handling growth in data size or complexity without losing performance.
15.	Define 'programmer'.
A person who writes and tests code to create computer programs or algorithms.
16.	Define time complexity.
The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as the input size increases.
17.	Give a synonym for the word 'execute'.
Run, perform, or carry out
18.	What does the term 'brute-force' mean?
Trying every possible solution to solve a problem.
19.	Define 'machine learning'.
A branch of AI where algorithms learn from data to identify patterns and make predictions.
20.	What is the meaning of the term 'algorithmic fairness'?
The principle of creating algorithms that are ethical and do not discriminate against individuals.
