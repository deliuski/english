Comprehension Questions
1.	What is quantum computing?
Quantum computing is a field of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations beyond the capabilities of classical computers.
2.	What is a qubit?
A qubit is a unit of quantum information that can exist in a superposition of states, unlike classical bits which are either 0 or 1.
3.	What is superposition?
Superposition is a property of quantum systems in which qubits can exist in multiple states at once, allowing many calculations to be performed simultaneously.
4.	What is decoherence?
Decoherence is the process by which qubits lose their quantum state due to interaction with the environment, which can disrupt calculations.
5.	What is entanglement?
Entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated and share a quantum state, enabling certain calculations to be done much faster.
6.	What are quantum gates?
Quantum gates are basic operations used to manipulate the quantum state of qubits.
7.	What are quantum algorithms?
Quantum algorithms are algorithms specifically designed to run on quantum computers, taking advantage of qubits, superposition, and entanglement.
8.	What is quantum supremacy?
Quantum supremacy is the point at which a quantum computer can solve problems faster than the most powerful classical computers.
