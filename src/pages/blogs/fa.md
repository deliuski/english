1.	Who was Charles Babbage?
Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, inventor, and philosopher, known as the father of the computer for designing the first mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine.
2.	What inspired Babbage to design the Difference Engine?
Babbage was inspired by the errors in mathematical tables, which caused problems in navigation, engineering, and science. He wanted a machine that could perform calculations more accurately and efficiently than humans.
3.	What was the Difference Engine, and how was it supposed to work?
The Difference Engine was a mechanical calculating machine designed in 1822. It used gears and cranks, stored input data on punched cards, and could automatically produce printed results.
4.	Why was the Difference Engine ultimately unsuccessful?
The project was unsuccessful due to technical challenges and lack of sufficient funding from the British government.
5.	What was the Analytical Engine, and how did it differ from the Difference Engine?
The Analytical Engine was a more advanced machine than the Difference Engine. It could perform more complex calculations, was programmable, and used punched cards to store instructions, making it more versatile in solving mathematical problems.
6.	Why was Babbage never able to complete the Analytical Engine?
He could not complete it because of technical difficulties and lack of funding.
